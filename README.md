# Test sample writing API document based on OpenAPI v.3.0.0 spec

In this repo you can see a small snippet of sample API documentation based on a OpenAPI specification (v.3.0.0). UI rendering is supported by `Redoc`.
This API documentation can be interactive through the use of [github pages](https://pages.github.com/).
If you are still using swager version 2.0 I advise you to switch to OpenAPI. More details about the specification are available here - [OpenAPI specification](https://swagger.io/specification/).
